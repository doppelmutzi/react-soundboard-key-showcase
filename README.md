This is a companion React project to my article about the [key property](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html). It's purpose is to showcase bugs with unfavourable keys.

This project was originally developed for a React beginner workshop.

All example sounds are downloaded from [SoundBible](http://soundbible.com/).
